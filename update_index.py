"""
Updates the plugin index with the latest version and descriptions from
PyPI.

The index file (index.json) contains all plugins found by a search for
"pytest-" in PyPI in order to find all pytest plugins. We then save their
latest version and description into index.json, which will be read by
"run.py" in order to execute compatibility tests between the plugins
and pytest/python versions. See "run.py" for more details.

Usage:

    python update_index.py

If index.json was updated, it should be pushed back to GitHub, which will
trigger a new travis build using the new versions.
